**Please Note, This was the first ever PHP web app that i've written. I lost some of my code due to my external Hard drive corruption. I've has some backups on my google drive which have been uplaoded here. 
The FrontEnd for the website was designed using a Free Theme, some changes were made to it by me.**

The website is meant to serve as a foundation for creating a B2C marketplace. It has basic features such as, login/register, messaging within the application, confirmation of order, editing profiles, managing items etc. It does not include a setup of payment methods
The website only includes the main code samples used to code it and as well as a copy of the SQL DB.
It is recommended to NOT user this database as it manages passwords in a very poor manner. The website was made for a course project i was doing and was never intended for anything else.
