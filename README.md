The website is meant to serve as a foundation for creating a B2C marketplace. It has basic features such as, login/register, messaging within the application, confirmation of order, editing profiles, managing items etc. It does not include a setup of payment methods
The website only includes the main code samples used to code it and as well as a copy of the SQL DB.
It is recommended to NOT user this database as it manages passwords in a very poor manner. The website was made for a course project i was doing and was never intended for anything else.
